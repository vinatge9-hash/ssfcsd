# Brew & Beans Coffee Shop - Website Build

This is a complete, self-contained, tailwind-based website for a coffee shop with four pages:

- index.html (Home)
- about.html (About)
- menu.html (Menu)
- contact.html (Contact)

How to use:

1) Open any HTML file in a browser to view the page.
2) The navigation across pages is wired via relative links (index.html, about.html, menu.html, contact.html).
3) Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts to match the Coffee Shop typography: Montserrat for headings and Open Sans for body.
4) Images use placeholder tokens in the form https://images.pexels.com/photos/1634011/pexels-photo-1634011.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940. Replace these with real image URLs as you prepare assets.
5) All styling uses Tailwind CSS classes only (no separate CSS files).

Notes:
- For production, replace placeholders with actual assets and hosts.
- Consider adding a real favicon and a robots.txt for better SEO.
- Update meta descriptions per page for better search visibility.
